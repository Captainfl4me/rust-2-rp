= Delaying a Task

In an embedded program, delaying a task is one of the most common actions taken. In an event loop, delays will need to be inserted to ensure
that other tasks have a chance to run before the next iteration of the loop is called, if no other I/O is performed. Embassy provides an abstraction
to delay the current task for a specified interval of time.

Timing is serviced by the `embassy::time::Timer` struct, which provides two timing methods.

`Timer::at` creates a future that completes at the specified `Instant`, relative to the system boot time.
`Timer::after` creates a future that completes after the specified `Duration`, relative to when the future was created.

An example of a delay is provided as follows:

[,rust]
----
use embassy::executor::{task, Executor};
use embassy::time::{Duration, Timer};

#[task]
/// Task that ticks periodically
async fn tick_periodic() -> ! {
    loop {
        rprintln!("tick!");
        // async sleep primitive, suspends the task for 500ms.
        Timer::after(Duration::from_millis(500)).await;
    }
}
